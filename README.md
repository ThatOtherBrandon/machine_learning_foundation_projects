## üìÇ Topics Covered  

### 1. **Finding the Right Dataset**  
Discovering the right dataset is critical to any machine learning project.  
- Platforms to explore datasets:  
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)  
  - [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)  
  - [Awesome Public Datasets (GitHub)](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)  

### 2. **CRISP-DM Framework**  
A structured approach to machine learning:  
1. **Business Understanding**: Define project goals and success metrics.  
2. **Data Understanding**: Explore and familiarize yourself with the dataset.  
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean, preprocess, and transform data for modeling.  
4. **Modeling**: Build and test models using algorithms.  
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with appropriate metrics.  
6. **Deployment**: Deliver the model into production.  

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics Explained**  
Understanding key evaluation metrics:  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures average error magnitude without considering direction.  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Penalizes larger errors more than MAE, useful for regression tasks.  
- **Precision**: The percentage of correctly predicted positive observations.  
- **Recall**: The ability to capture all relevant positive observations.  
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.  

### 4. **Clear Documentation**  
Proper documentation is essential for reproducibility and collaboration. These are some of the projects that I completed in my undergrad take a look! 
- **Project Examples**:  
  - [Project 1:voting behavior predictor](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gJJJ3ywcjCHdWgMrJwR3Qc8Iz_rW2jWV?usp=sharing)
  - [Project 2: Wine quality prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1leSZP60Q6W1mzMNxOGPKRkKLgmISSsIm?usp=sharing)

## üìà Example Projects  

### Project 1: Predicting Housing Prices  
**Objective**: Build a regression model to predict house prices using features like location, size, and amenities.  
**Dataset**: [California Housing Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset)  
**Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib  

### Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews  
**Objective**: Use natural language processing (NLP) to classify product reviews as positive or negative.  
**Dataset**: Custom-scraped dataset of Amazon product reviews.  
**Tools**: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, WordCloud
